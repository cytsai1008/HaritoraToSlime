# HaritoraToSlime  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a WIP project, and it still not working properly yet.

## How to use
1. Install SlimeVR
2. Install Python and its dependency `pip install python-osc`
3. Open SlimeVR Server and enable OSC routing, set input port to `9000` and output port to `12345` (I don't know why, but it's required to receive data)
4. Open `HaritoraX App` on iOS or `haritorax` on Android, and click `Start` (for more details, read the HaritoraX manual)
5. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` (if you are using Linux)
6. ~~Hope nothing went wrong~~
